# Getting started

This project was created with Create React App, made for testing some USWDS features.

1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start`

## Testing USWDS Core

There are currently two react components available:

- `uswds-core-js.js`
- `uswds-styles.js`

These are stateless components that showcase using uswds-core styles **and** scripts.
